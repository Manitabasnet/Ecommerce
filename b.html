			   <h3>Imapcts of electronic gadgets in Children</h3>
			<p >Technology and the current social environment have had a significant influence on most aspects of young life, with the majority of children playing with electronic devices such as cellphones, tablets, and computers. Children used to play with their friends and neighbors back in the day.They didn't have sophisticated toys to play with in the past, so they relied on classic games like hide-and-seek, pick-up sticks, and jumping rope. Computers, cellphones, and tablets are examples of electronic devices to which we might become addicted, particularly young people. Children are so interested in their phones and laptops that they will spend the entire night playing games, searching the web, talking, and so on. This is potentially hazardous. Parents have taught their children how to use gadgets responsibly. Children require appropriate sleep to be active during the day, yet today's children spend more time on their phones and laptops. </p>

		<h3>Impacts of electronic gadgets on environment</h3>
	     <p >Electronic garbage, commonly known as e-waste, is the term for electronic items that have reached the end of their "useful life." Computers, monitors, TVs, stereos, copiers, printers, fax machines, smartphones, dvd players, cameras, batteries, and a wide range of other electronic equipment fall into this category. Toxic elements such as lead, zinc, nickel, fire retardants, barium, and chromium are found in computers and other gadgets. Lead, in particular, can harm human blood, kidneys, and central and peripheral nerve systems if discharged into the environment.When e-waste is heated, hazardous compounds are discharged into the atmosphere, harming the environment. One of the most serious environmental consequences of e-waste is the pollution of the atmosphere.When electronic garbage is buried, harmful compounds leak into the groundwater, hurting both land and sea species.</p>

		<h3>Gadgets effect on mental changes</h3>
	    <p >Children and students, in particular, spend more time playing games. Playing video games can also slow down the brain development. Students who spend a lot of time on devices are more likely to become aggressive, lose interest in other aspects of their surroundings, become lazy, lose interest in other hobbies, and lose interest in academics. This issue causes children/students to develop negative personalities. This is how electronic gadgets effects on mental heath.</p>
